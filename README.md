# Arch CLI

Arch is a lightweight CLI tool to scaffold **feature-based Clean Architecture** folder structures.
It can be used with any project type â€” .NET, Blazor, Web, Flutter, Node.js, or even plain folders.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Download the installer (`arch-installer.exe`) from the [Releases](./dist/installer).
2. Run the installer â€” this will place `arch.exe` into `C:\Program Files\Arch\bin`.

After installation, you can run `arch` globally from any terminal.

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Arch provides two commands:

### 1. Create a feature in the current directory

```sh
arch Todo
```

âž¡ Creates a `Todo` feature folder with the standard Clean Architecture structure in your **current working directory**.

### 2. Create a feature in a specific path

```sh
arch Todo ../MyApp/Features
```

âž¡ Creates the same `Todo` feature folder inside the **path you provide**.

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure

Every feature generated will follow this structure:

```
<FeatureName>/
 â”œâ”€â”€ Data/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Datasources/
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Repositories/
     â””â”€â”€ DTOs/
     â””â”€â”€ Mappings/
 â”œâ”€â”€ Domain/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Entities/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Repositories/
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ UseCases/
 â””â”€â”€ Presentation/
     â””â”€â”€ Pages/
```

## ðŸ”§ Examples
